 ### 1. Create a changeable list for the five days of the week called 'daysOfTheWeek' and print each one by using a loop.
 */

 ### 2. Create an unchanging list for the five days of the week called 'weekDays' and print each one by using a loop, prefixed by the position of the day of the week.

 ### 3. Create an empty array of strings called 'emptyArray' and check to see if it's empty, printing appropriate messages.
 */

 ### 4.  Create an array of strings called 'funColors'. The colors in the array should be "red", "blue" and "green". Check to see if it's NOT empty, printing an appropriate message.
 */

/*: question5
 ### 5. Find out the size of the 'daysOfTheWeek' array created earlier, and print it to the screen.
 */

/*: question6
 ### 6. Add the two days of the weekend to the 'daysOfTheWeek array and then loop through the array to print all the values.
 */

/*: question7
 ### 7. Some people start the week on a Sunday. Remove Sunday from the end of the 'daysOfTheWeek' array and then re-add it to the beginning of the array.
 */

/*: question8
 ### 8. Loop through the 'daysofTheWeek' array and print each value to the console as lower case.
