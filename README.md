## Overview

In this lab, you'll use the following methods on arrays:
* `append()`  
* `insert(_:at:)`  
* `remove(at:)`  
* *subscript syntax* with arrays  
* `count`  
* `isEmpty`  

## Instructions

* Open up the playground file included with this repo and answer the listed questions (which you will find in the playground file) in order. 
* There are no tests associated with this playground file.
* The following two screenshots are included to assist you in case the file doesn't open right to the main.swift file (which it should by default).
* Make sure you're working in the main.swift file (which you can view by pressing command + 0):
